# Project plan:


### Train model to detect a brand in image

Example: 89% probability this image contains Pepsi

### Train model to segment a brand in image

Example: I think this part of the image outlined contains pepsi



### Ability to search for new brand and auto train on new brand for segmentation

Classifier is only trained on pepsi but I would like it to detect mountain dew. I can add a argument from terminal to auto download images from searched brand and retrain to detect.

- get search parameter
- download images from search
- Augemnt for training
- train model on new brand
